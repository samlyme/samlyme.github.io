# husk 

[github](https://github.com/samlyme/husk)

this is my own markdown to html converter that i wrote. it is bad, but good enough for what i use it for. 

the idea is to write everything in markdown, then have husk generate html files for you. 

# why?

1. i wanted to learn haskell.
2. interesting problem for me to solve.

## implementation

i used haskell (btw) for this, because the functional and pure nature lends itself nicely to creating deterministic mappings from one domain into another. in this case, from markdown to html.  

### representing html in haskell

blah blah

### parsing markdown

blah blah

## improvements and todos

better handling of malformed markdown.

better support for links, email, and embeds.

better support for templates.
