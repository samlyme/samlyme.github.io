# this website is written in haskell and markdown

[github](https://github.com/samlyme/samlyme.github.io)

the idea is to write your content in markdown, then have a program convert it to static html that can be deployed. 

## why?

1. i don't like writing html.
2. i wanted to learn haskell.

## implementation

i implemented my own markdown to html parser/converter library called [husk](/projects/husk.html). i use this to parse and generate individual html files. the file structure logic is handled in the `main.hs` file.
