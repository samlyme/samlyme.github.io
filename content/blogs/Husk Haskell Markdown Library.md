This is my own markdown to html converter that I wrote. 

I used to actually use this library, but I have since switched to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

# Why?

1. I wanted to learn haskell.
2. Interesting problem for me to solve.

## implementation

I used Haskell for this, because the functional and pure nature lends itself nicely to creating deterministic mappings from one domain into another. In this case, from MarkDown to HTML.
