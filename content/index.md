## About me

I am a CS student, minoring in data science and math. I enjoy solving interesting problems. I've worked on a variety of projects and hackathons, so I am comfortable in the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Java
- Haskell
- MIPS assembly (ish)

I am comfortable in the following technologies:

- PyTorch, Numpy
- FastAPI
- Express
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Railway VPS

Currently, I am working as an undergraduate research assistant. I am working on developing a novel **decentralized task allocation algorithm** utilizing **physics informed reinforcement learning** to efficiently generate collision-free task execution plans.

I also like writing [blogs](/blogs/index.html) about my projects and whatever stuff I find interesting.
