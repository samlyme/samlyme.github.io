this is my website.

it is written in haskell (btw) [learn more.](/blogs/index.html)

## about me

i am a cs student, minoring in data science and math. i enjoy solving interesting problems (hence me writing my website in haskell and markdown). i've worked on a variety of projects and hackathons, so i am comfortable in the following languages:
- python
- javascript
- typescript
- haskell (ish, only one project)
- java (ish)
-  c/c++ (ish)
- MIPS assembly (ish)

i am comfortable in the following technologies:
- pytorch, numpy
- fastAPI
- express
- react
- postgresql
- railway vps

> java and c/c++ i only really use in academic settings, ie. learning data structures and programming concepts, so i do not consider myself proficient in any technologies specific to those languages.

currently, i am working as an undergraduate researcher. i am working on developing a novel "intention" based drone path prediction, which incorporates both a physics aware model and a LSTM model to predict the expected behavior, or "intention" of the drone. 

i also like writing [blogs](/blogs/index.html) about stuff i find interesting.
