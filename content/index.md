## about me

i am a cs student, minoring in data science and math. i enjoy solving interesting problems (hence me writing my website in haskell and markdown). i've worked on a variety of projects and hackathons, so i am comfortable in the following languages:
- python
- javascript
- typescript
- java
- haskell
- MIPS assembly (ish)

i am comfortable in the following technologies:
- pytorch, numpy
- fastAPI
- express
- react
- postgresql
- railway vps

currently, i am working as an undergraduate researcher. i am working on developing a novel "intention" based drone path prediction, which incorporates both a physics aware model and a LSTM model to predict the expected behavior, or "intention" of the drone. 

i also like writing [blogs](/blogs/index.html) about my projects and whatever stuff i find interesting.
